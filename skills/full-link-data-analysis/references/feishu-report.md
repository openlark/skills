## Output Considerations

- Do not include Python code or tool execution traces in the report
- Format numbers in a human-friendly way (e.g., "1.23 million" rather than "1,230,000")
- Use text to describe charts; do not actually generate images (unless requested by user)
- All comparative conclusions must specify the "comparison baseline"
- Avoid vague language (e.g., "significant" must be paired with p-value, "large" must be paired with percentage)
